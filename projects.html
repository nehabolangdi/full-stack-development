        <h3>Hangman in c</h3> <br />
        It is a popular word game in which one player (the "chooser") chooses a secret word and another player (the "guesser") attempts to guess the word one letter at a time. If a guessed letter appears in the word, all instances of it are revealed. If not, the guesser loses a chance. If the guesser figures out the secret word before he or she runs out of chances, he or she wins. If not, the player who chose the word wins.
